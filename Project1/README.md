**Data** - consists of the real terrain data used in the report

**Functions** - Consists of the class of linear regressions (OLS, Ridge, Lasso, MSE, R2 score) both manual and scikit-learn setup, manual cross-validation,
           bootstrap, franke and the design matrix functions.
           
**Plots** - Graphs and figures used in the report

**UnitTests** - Unit tests of the franke function, linear regression class and design matrix 

The unit tests are provided using pytest. Run the test anywhere within the directory using:
```
pytest -v
```
