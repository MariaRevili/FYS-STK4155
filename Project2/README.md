Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:MariaRevili/FYS-STK4155.git 
```

**Functions** - Consists of the class of neural networks, multinomial logistic regression (i.e. softmax regression) both, manual and scikit-learn setup, and stochastic gradient                   decent

**Plots** - Graphs and figures used in the report

**UnitTests** - Unit tests of neural  networks, multinomial logistic regression

**JupyterNotebook** - Jupyter notebook with the codes and the output

The unit tests are provided using pytest. Run the test anywhere within the directory using:
```
pytest -v
```
